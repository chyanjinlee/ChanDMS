    <h1>How long will it take to see results from working out?</h1>
    <p>TUnlike improving your cardiovascular health or losing weight, you might see increased muscle gains from a strength training program after a single session, research has shown. That’s due to a phenomenon called “muscle pump,” which is just a casual term for the increased blood, oxygen, and lactic acid that is being moved to your muscles during a super-intense lifting session. (Granted, it’s only a temporary movement of fluids, but hey, it’s something!)
        Machowsky adds that strength gains can initially happen within four to six weeks if you're new to lifting because of neuromuscular adaptation—a.k.a., your body is becoming "more efficient using the existing muscle to move the weight,
        he says. It's less about an increase in muscle mass and more about the efficiency of the muscle, he adds.
        Consider that initial boost in your muscle size a preview of gains to come—which occur roughly six to eight weeks into a strength training program if you’re a beginner, and eight to 12 weeks if you’re more advanced, says Wilson. However, she notes, “this is going to look different for everyone because there are a lot of factors that play into muscle hypertrophy.
